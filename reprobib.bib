	abstract = {A general coefficient measuring the similarity between two sampling units is defined. The matrix of similarities between all pairs of sample units is shown to be positive semidefinite (except possibly when there are missing values). This is important for the multidimensional Euclidean representation of the sample and also establishes some inequalities amongst the similarities relating three individuals. The definition is extended to cope with a hierarchy of characters.},

	abstract = {Previous research has resulted in a number of different algorithms for rule discovery. Two approaches discussed here, the ‘all-rules’ algorithm and multi-objective metaheuristics, both result in the production of a large number of partial classification rules, or ‘nuggets’, for describing different subsets of the records in the class of interest. This paper describes the application of a number of different clustering algorithms to these rules, in order to identify similar rules and to better understand the data.},
